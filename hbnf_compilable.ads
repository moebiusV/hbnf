--  HBNF_Compilable: schema shapes the compiled backends cannot yet express.

--  The emitters flatten a group inside a sequence into plain concatenation,
--  so an alternation, an optional or a repetition there used to compile into
--  a parser for a different language, with no diagnostic.  Check turns those
--  into generation-time errors until the emitters implement them; the
--  interpreter (HBNF_Match) handles all of them and does not call this.
--
--  Backend is the --backend= value; repetition bounds other than `*` are
--  enforced by the C backend only, so the other backends get a warning.
